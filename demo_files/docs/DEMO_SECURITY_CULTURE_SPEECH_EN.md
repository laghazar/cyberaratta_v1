### 🔥 Introduction

Good afternoon, everyone.

Today, I want to focus on a topic that is fundamental to the success of any digital platform—building a security and privacy-first culture. At CyberAratta, this philosophy is at the heart of our design, development, and daily operations.

### 🌍 Why Security and Privacy Matter

In today’s interconnected world, data breaches, cyberattacks, and privacy violations are not just technical issues—they are threats to our trust, our safety, and our national resilience. Armenia, like many countries, is experiencing a surge in cyber incidents, making it essential to prioritize security and privacy at every level.

- **Trust is the foundation**: Users must feel confident that their data and actions are protected.
- **Privacy is a right**: Every citizen deserves control over their personal information.
- **Security is a shared responsibility**: From developers to end-users, everyone plays a role.
