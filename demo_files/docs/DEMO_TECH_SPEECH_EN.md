### üî• Introduction

Good afternoon, colleagues and cybersecurity professionals.

Today, I am excited to present CyberAratta, Armenia‚Äôs first integrated cybersecurity platform, designed to address the unique challenges of our digital landscape with a robust, modular, and scalable architecture.

---

### üåç Problem Statement & Motivation

Armenia faces a rapidly evolving threat environment:
- Over 150 documented phishing incidents and 240 cyber threat records in the past year
- Fragmented incident response across organizations
- Lack of centralized threat intelligence and real-time data sharing
- Limited local language support in global solutions

CyberAratta was engineered to solve these gaps with a unified, API-driven platform tailored for Armenian needs.

### üõ°Ô∏è Platform Architecture & Modules

CyberAratta consists of four core modules, each built as a Django app with RESTful APIs and real-time data pipelines:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Threat Map
- Aggregates and visualizes threat data using Leaflet.js and WebSocket live feeds
- Supports geo-tagged incident mapping and trend analytics
- Integrates with external threat intelligence sources via scheduled Celery tasks

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Phishing Reporting
- Secure evidence upload and structured incident forms
- Automated notification to emergency contacts (Police, CERT, Embassy)
- Data validation and deduplication using custom Django model logic

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ URL Checker
- Multi-engine URL scanning (VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing, local heuristics)
- Asynchronous scan jobs managed by Celery workers
- Result caching and visualization with Chart.js

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Educational Quiz
- Dynamic question bank with difficulty scaling
- User progress tracking and certificate generation
- Real-time leaderboard and analytics

### üöÄ Technical Features & Innovations

- **Full Armenian localization**: All UI and API endpoints support Armenian and English
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket and AJAX for live dashboard statistics
- **Modular microservice-ready design**: Each module can be containerized and scaled independently
- **API-first approach**: All data accessible via documented REST endpoints
- **Secure file handling**: Evidence files stored with access controls and audit logs
- **Cache busting**: Versioned static assets for reliable updates
- **Automated test data population**: populate_demo_data.py script for instant demo readiness

### üéØ Demo Walkthrough

Let‚Äôs walk through the technical demo:
1. **Threat Map**: Real-time incident visualization, geo-filters, and external feed integration
2. **Phishing Reporting**: Submit a report, upload evidence, and trigger automated notifications
3. **URL Checker**: Scan a URL, view multi-engine results, and analyze security recommendations
4. **Quiz System**: Take a quiz, track progress, and view leaderboard analytics

All modules communicate via internal APIs, and the dashboard updates every 10 seconds for live effect.

### üîÆ Roadmap & Scalability

- **AI-powered threat detection**: Integrate ML models for phishing and anomaly detection
- **Mobile app development**: Native iOS/Android clients with push notifications
- **Sectoral integration**: Connect with banking, telecom, and government systems
- **Regional expansion**: Support for neighboring countries and cross-border threat sharing
- **Continuous security audits**: Automated vulnerability scanning and compliance checks
