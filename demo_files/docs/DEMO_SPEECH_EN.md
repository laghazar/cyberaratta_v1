### 🔥 Introduction (1 minute)

**Hello, dear guests!**

Today, I am honored to present to you CyberAratta, Armenia’s first comprehensive cybersecurity platform. Our country, like every nation in the world, faces cyber threats, but until now, we have not had a unified system to effectively respond to these challenges.

### 🌍 Why is CyberAratta Important for Armenia? (1.5 minutes)

- **Rising Cyber Threats**: In recent years, Armenia has seen a significant increase in cyberattacks, with one of the highest rates per capita globally.
- **Lack of Awareness**: Many of our citizens do not know how to recognize phishing attacks or what to do when they receive suspicious links.
- **Fragmented Approach**: Different organizations work in isolation, without sharing information.
- **Need for Local Solutions**: International platforms do not consider our local specifics or the importance of the Armenian language.
