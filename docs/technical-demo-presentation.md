## Security Analysis System

[Live Demo Screen]

- Trusted domain validation system
- Integration with security APIs
- Pattern-based threat detection
- Categorized security results
```

**Speech:**
"Let me demonstrate one of our core features - the URL and Email Security Scanner. What makes our scanner unique is its integration with trusted security services. We've implemented connections to VirusTotal and Kaspersky APIs, with an extensible system that can accommodate additional providers in the future.

Let me show you a live scan. When I enter this suspicious URL, the system first checks our curated list of trusted Armenian domains like gov.am and edu.am. For unknown domains, it processes the request through our security scanning pipeline. The system analyzes URLs based on multiple factors, including reputation data from security services and our own pattern analysis. The results are classified as Safe (‘±’∂’æ’ø’°’∂’£), Suspicious (‘ø’°’Ω’Ø’°’Æ’•’¨’´), or Malicious (’é’ø’°’∂’£’°’æ’∏÷Ä), giving users clear guidance on potential threats."

### Slide 6: Security Awareness Quiz System

**Content:**
```
# Interactive Security Education
## Culturally Relevant Training

[Quiz Interface Demo]

- Audience-specific content targeting
- Professional field specialization
- Progressive learning algorithms
- Armenian cultural gamification elements
```

**Speech:**
"Education is central to improving security posture, but generic training rarely drives engagement. Our Quiz System takes a different approach by combining security education with culturally relevant elements.

The system adapts content based on three primary audience segments: school students (‘¥’∫÷Ä’∏÷Å’°’Ø’°’∂), university students (’à÷Ç’Ω’°’∂’∏’≤), and professionals (’Ñ’°’Ω’∂’°’£’´’ø’°’Ø’°’∂). For the professional category, we further specialize content for government (’ä’•’ø’°’Ø’°’∂), banking (‘≤’°’∂’Ø’°’µ’´’∂), education (‘ø÷Ä’©’°’Ø’°’∂), and IT sectors.

Let me demonstrate the quiz experience. Users select their category and difficulty level, then progress through a series of security awareness questions. We've implemented two distinct quiz formats: an educational format (’à÷Ç’Ω’∏÷Ç÷Å’∏’≤’°’Ø’°’∂ ’î’∏÷Ç’´’¶) with detailed explanations and a 'Millionaire' style format (’Ñ’´’¨’´’∏’∂’°’ø’•÷Ä) that gamifies the learning experience.

What makes this particularly engaging for Armenian users is our integration of cultural elements. Based on performance, users receive character assessments based on Armenian cultural figures like Ara Geghecik and Shamiram. This cultural connection makes the security training more relevant and memorable for our users."

### Slide 7: Phishing Incident Reporting

**Content:**
```
# Structured Incident Reporting
## Comprehensive Evidence Collection

[Reporting Interface Demo]

- Multi-format evidence upload system
- Advanced damage classification
- Automated threat data extraction
- Cross-reference with existing threats
```

**Speech:**
"Effective threat intelligence depends on quality incident reporting. Our Phishing Incident Reporting system streamlines this process while capturing essential information about threats.

When users encounter a suspicious email or website, they can submit a structured report through this interface. The system supports multiple evidence formats with carefully implemented security controls: 5MB for images, 10MB for documents, 50MB for videos, and 15MB for audio files.

A key feature is our damage classification system. Reports are categorized into specific damage types including data breaches (’è’æ’µ’°’¨’∂’•÷Ä’´ ’°÷Ä’ø’°’∞’∏’Ω÷Ñ), financial losses (’ñ’´’∂’°’∂’Ω’°’Ø’°’∂ ’Ø’∏÷Ä’∏÷Ç’Ω’ø’∂’•÷Ä), account compromise (’ï’£’ø’°’∞’°’∑’æ’´ ’Ø’∏÷Ä’∏÷Ç’Ω’ø), device control loss (’ç’°÷Ä÷Ñ’´ ’æ’•÷Ä’°’∞’Ω’Ø’∏’≤’∏÷Ç’©’µ’°’∂ ’Ø’∏÷Ä’∏÷Ç’Ω’ø), and more. This structured approach allows us to generate meaningful statistics and identify trends in reported incidents.

When a report is submitted, the system stores the information securely and makes it available for analysis. The reporting system is designed to be simple for users while capturing the details security professionals need to respond effectively to threats."
